//1177. Can Make Palindrome from Substring
//Difficulty: Medium
//Tags: String, Hash Table

// Key Concepts:
// Palindrome: A string that reads the same forward and backward, like "racecar" or "madam."
// Odd and Even Character Counts: To form a palindrome:
// If the length of the string is even, every character must appear an even number of times.
// If the length is odd, only one character can appear an odd number of times (this will be the middle character), while all others must appear an even number of times.
// Given this, for any substring to be rearranged into a palindrome:

// We need to count how many characters appear an odd number of times.
// If the number of characters with odd counts is small enough, we can make the string a palindrome by replacing some of those odd-count characters with other characters. The number of replacements allowed is given by k.
// How the Solution Works:
// Prefix Array: The solution uses a prefix array to efficiently count how many times each character appears up to a certain index in the string.
// prefix[i] contains a frequency count of all characters in the substring s[0...i-1].
// To find the frequency of each character in a specific substring s[lo...hi], you can subtract prefix[lo] from prefix[hi+1].

// Odd Count Calculation:
// For each query, we extract the character counts for the substring and check how many characters appear an odd number of times.

// Replacement Calculation:
// If there are odd characters with odd counts in the substring, then we need at least (odd - 1) / 2 replacements to convert them into a palindrome. The formula used is:
//     odd‚â§2ùëò+(sum%2)
// This formula checks whether we can handle all odd characters by using at most k replacements.
